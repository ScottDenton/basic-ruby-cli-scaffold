# Here's your CLI class! I've included some starter code so you
#   can get a sense on how you might use it! Remember: this
#   class doesn't represent anything in your databse: it's
#   here simply to encapsulate your CLI methods!

# Pro-tip: think about how you might use class and instance
#   variables in a class like this!

class CLI
  def initialize
    puts "Initializing new CLI"
  end

  # def beef
  #   puts "Are you a beefy steak? (y/n)"
  #   answer = gets.chomp.downcase
  #
  #   if answer == "y"
  #     puts "Welcome!"
  #   elsif answer == "n"
  #     puts "Oh no!"
  #   else
  #     puts "Whoa! That's not y OR n! Looks like you need some protein!"
  #     return self.beef
  #   end
  # end
  binding.pry
